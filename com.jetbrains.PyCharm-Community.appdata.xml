				<ul>
					<li>AltGr works correctly</li>
					<li>Previously, Python 3.8 pre-release interpreters were detected as Python 3.7, they’re now correctly identified as Python 3.8</li>
					<li>Various issues related to Conda environments have been fixed</li>
					<li>Some JavaScript and Angular inspection issues were resolved</li>
				</ul>

		<release version="2019.1" date="2019-03-27">
			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>Jupyter Notebooks support has been completely redesigned. Direct editing of Notebooks is now available in PyCharm 2019.1, with a convenient side-by-side view that helps you get a better overview of your Notebook’s source code while seeing the output right next to it. You can run and debug cells straight from the IDE.</li>
					<li>Quick documentation for HTML and CSS has been improved. Quick question: when writing a ‘padding’ property in CSS, what comes first? Left and right, or top and bottom? Just write ‘padding’ in a CSS file and press Ctrl-Q (or Ctrl-J on macOS) to find the answer!</li>
					<li>Navigate quickly to recent locations, rather than files. When you’re making quick edits, you frequently need to go back and forth between locations. The recent files popup (Ctrl-E, or Cmd-E on macOS) has always been there to quickly move between files you’re editing, but now we’ve also got the new and improved recent locations popup. Try it now: just press Ctrl-Shift-E (or Cmd-Shift-E on macOS).</li>
					<li>We’ve ending support for two Python versions: 2.6 (that has been end-of-life since 2013), and 3.4 (which just reached end-of-life). If you’re still using these versions, you’ll receive a warning that these versions are no longer supported. Some PyCharm functionality might no longer work, and we won’t fix any bugs related to these Python versions anymore.</li>
				</ul>

		</release>
		<release version="2018.3.5" date="2019-02-27">
			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>If you have a private key with a passphrase, and would use to like native ssh rather than our built-in client for accessing remote git repositories, you’re now able to enter your passphrase in a dialog. This was previously only possible in combination with ssh-agent.</li>
					<li>The behavior of search everywhere was adjusted to rank partial filename matches higher in the results.</li>
					<li>The plugins redesign lead to issues with installing plugins offline. This has been resolved.</li>
				</ul>
			</description>
		</release>
		<release version="2018.3.4" date="2019-01-30">
			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>Pasting a new name over a variable that was defined right after an indented block, would cause PyCharm to incorrectly indent the variable.</li>
					<li>In some cases inserting a newline in an f-string would lead to invalid code.</li>
					<li>PyCharm can now create Python 3.7 Conda environments</li>
					<li>Many improvements in SQL support. Did you know that PyCharm Professional Edition bundles all features from JetBrains DataGrip in its Database tool window?</li>
				</ul>

		<release version="2018.3" date="2018-11-21">
			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>For those of you on Windows who are developing applications that run on Linux: Windows Subsystem for Linux is a quick and easy way to always have a Linux environment available. PyCharm 2018.3 can now be configured to use a Python interpreter inside WSL.</li>
					<li>One of the most-requested features in our issue tracker were multiline TODOs, and we’re happy to announce that these are now available in PyCharm 2018.3.</li>
					<li>Even though search everywhere (double-shift) is not at all a new feature, we’ve made some great usability improvements, and now it’s easy to see how you can narrow down the results.</li>
				</ul>

		</release>
		<release version="2018.2.5" date="2018-11-14">

			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>Various small pipenv improvements</li>
					<li>A bug in our pytest with fixtures support was fixed: previously, if yield statements were used in the fixture, PyCharm would assume that the return type of the function was a Generator. Now, the correct return type is inferred, preventing false positives.</li>
